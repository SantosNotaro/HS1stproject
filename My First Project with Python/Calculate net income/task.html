<p>This stage is the last stage in this project, which means that when you
    complete it, you will also complete the project itself.</p>
<p>You likely have already noticed, that each stage is provided with
    examples of how the program should work in the <strong>Examples</strong>
    section. There may be one, two, or even more examples, depending on the
    complexity of the program.</p>
<p>The program typically operates in a loop since it often requires user input. It presents some information, retrieves some from the user, and then repeats this process.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">In examples, every input is represented by a greater-than symbol followed by a space(<code class="java">&gt; </code>).</div>
<p>That said, let's review this example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">What's your name?
&gt; Bob
Hello, Bob!</code></pre>
<p>This example demonstrates that the program should initially show the message
    'What's your name?' and then request input from the user. Upon receiving
    the response 'Bob', the program will display the final message 'Hello,
    Bob!'.</p>
<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In the final stage, let's calculate the shop's net income. To do this, you
    need to retrieve staff and other expenses from the user input and subtract
    them from the income you came up with in the previous stage.</p>
<p>You don't need to change the previous functionality of your program, but to
    expand it by adding both inputs and calculating the net income.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">Note that the <code class="java">input()</code> function returns a string
    value. Therefore, before performing subtraction, make sure to convert the
    retrieved value to an integer.</div>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>In this stage, your program should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Print the item names, what you earned for each of them and total
            earnings as before;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask users for staff expenses with the <code class="java">Staff expenses:</code>
            string and for other expenses with the <code class="java">Other expenses:</code>
            string;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate and print the net income as shown below.
            Replace <code class="java">0.0</code> with the actual net income:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Net income: $0.0</code></pre>
<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>
<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input: It is just used to separate the user input from the output of your program in the stage examples, you don't need to print the <code class="java">&gt;</code> sign!</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: <em>the user inputs 2000 for staff expenses and 205 for other expenses accordingly:</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Earned amount:
Bubblegum: $202
Toffee: $118
Ice cream: $2250
Milk chocolate: $1680
Doughnut: $1075
Pancake: $80

Income: $5405
Staff expenses:
&gt; 2000
Other expenses:
&gt; 205
Net income: $3200</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: <em>the user inputs 5203 for staff expenses and 400 for other expenses accordingly:</em></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Earned amount:
Bubblegum: $202
Toffee: $118
Ice cream: $2250
Milk chocolate: $1680
Doughnut: $1075
Pancake: $80

Income: $5405
Staff expenses:
&gt; 5203
Other expenses:
&gt; 400
Net income: $-198</code></pre>
